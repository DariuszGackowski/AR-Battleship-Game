🧠 AR-Battleship-Game
AR-Battleship-Game is a tactical board game using Augmented Reality (AR), where two factions fight for dominance using physical cards and digital 3D models. The game uses the device’s camera to detect cards and the board, bringing the tabletop to life with visual effects and interactive UI.

🎯 Core Features

🔍 AR-based recognition of cards and the board using image markers
🛡️ Two factions: each with their own base, unique units, and objectives
💥 Attacks and abilities: players can attack enemy units, defend their cards, or destroy the opponent's base
🧩 3D models appear above physical cards in real-time AR
🖱️ In-game UI lets players manage turns, choose actions, and check stats

🧱 Mechanics

📦 Physical cards with faction art and unit stats
🧠 3D models of units and buildings appear based on the card detected
🎮 Interactive context menus above units (attack, move, view info)
⏱️ Turn-based gameplay phases (move, attack, ability, end turn)

🔧 Technologies

Unity + AR Foundation
Vuforia or OpenCV (image recognition)
C# (logic, turn system, UI)
3D models (FBX)
Unity Canvas UI

🧪 Status

🔨 The project is a prototype. Core AR features and gameplay logic are functional. No further development is planned — the prototype phase is complete.
📁 Note: This repository contains only the game’s prototype code.

📌 Project Goal
An experimental fusion of physical board games and modern AR technology. Inspired by classic tabletop skirmish games, the project aimed to explore new ways of integrating digital content into analog gameplay.
